## Slice 1: Trust Lifecycle Pilot

### Row 1: Revocation Across Process Boundaries

- **Namespaced row IDs:** 01-G4, 01-G23, 01-G24, 05-G3
- **Behavior:** Revoke project trust durably so that a later run fails with
  `traces::cli::config_build_untrusted`.
- **Former test:** `e2e::trust::untrust_then_list_fails_with_the_untrusted_diagnostic`
- **Former layer:** `e2e`
- **Defect caught:** Untrust fails to revoke trust durably across process
  boundaries, which lets subsequent commands execute with untrusted
  configuration.
- **Survivor:** Scenario `Untrust revokes trust for later runs`
  (`tests/features/trust.feature`)
- **Proof:**
  - **Assertion comparison:** The survivor scenario S2 asserts at least what
    the old test asserted. The old test asserted `!list.is_success()` and
    substring `contains("traces::cli::config_build_untrusted")`, with
    unasserted stdout. Scenario S2 asserts exact exit code `1`, exact first
    line of stderr `traces::cli::config_build_untrusted`, and exact empty stdout
    `""`. S2 is strictly stronger.
  - **Kill demonstration:** Production code in `src/cli/untrust.rs` was
    modified so `untrust` omitted the call to `service.untrust(&subject)`,
    keeping the trust grant in the store. Both the old test and scenario S2
    failed when executed against the broken binary. The old test failed with
    `assertion failed: !list.is_success()`. Scenario S2 failed at `Then the exit
    code is 1` with `expected exit code 1, got Some(0)`. Reverting the
    modification restored both tests to passing.
  - **Mutation compare (before deletion):** Scoped run `mise run test:mutants -f
    src/config/trust.rs` generated 20 mutants. Result: 4 killed, 16 skipped, 0
    escaped. Escape set: `[]`.
  - **Mutation compare (after deletion):** Scoped run `mise run test:mutants -f
    src/config/trust.rs` generated 20 mutants. Result: 4 killed, 16 skipped, 0
    escaped. Escape set: `[]`. No new escape appeared. The baseline file
    `mutarust-baseline.json` stayed untouched.
  - **Name diff:** Verified `cargo nextest list --all-features --run-ignored all`
    before and after deletion. Exactly one test was removed:
    `traces::e2e trust::untrust_then_list_fails_with_the_untrusted_diagnostic`.
  - **Twin re-read:** Re-read
    `tests/e2e/trust.rs::trust_all_and_untrust_all_count_asserted_via_trust_list`.
    That test verifies the batch `--all` stream and confirms `trust list`
    reports empty stdout. It does not test the default single-project CLI
    round trip to a failing command. Re-read all tests touching `untrust` in
    `tests/e2e/workflow.rs`, `tests/e2e/config.rs`, `tests/e2e/process_contract.rs`,
    `src/cli/untrust.rs`, `src/config/service.rs`, and `src/config/trust.rs`.
    None is a duplicate twin of the cross-process CLI revocation-then-list
    guarantee.
- **Successor note for arch-design:** Trust revocation CLI behavior is verified
  through BDD feature `tests/features/trust.feature` (`Untrust revokes trust for
  later runs`). Step definitions live in `tests/e2e/bdd/trust.rs`.
- **Evidence note (mutarust behavior on test-only diff):** Executed `mise run
  test:mutants --git-diff --dry-run` with a diff limited to `tests/e2e/trust.rs`.
  The task generated 0 mutants (`Total: 0 mutation(s) would be generated`).
  Labelled as evidence only; never used as proof.

## Pilot Rubric Answers (Slice 1 Close)

- **Question 1: Does the BDD framework execute across all target operating
  systems in CI and local stress testing?**
  **Answer: Yes.**
  - **Evidence:** Draft PR 3 CI run
    (<https://github.com/JackMatanky/traces/actions/runs/41626080102>) passed
    across all three operating systems (Ubuntu, macOS, Windows).
  - Scenarios S1 (`Init does not grant trust`) and S2 (`Untrust revokes trust for
    later runs`) passed 100 of 100 iterations under local stress testing.

- **Question 2: Does the deletion and replacement procedure preserve coverage
  and prove that scenarios catch defects?**
  **Answer: Yes.**
  - **Evidence:** The kill demonstration in `src/cli/untrust.rs` broke both the
    former test and scenario S2 (`expected exit code 1, got Some(0)`).
  - The mutation compare on `src/config/trust.rs` produced 0 new escapes before
    and after deletion.
  - The sixth gate check resolves all pilot pointers (01-G4, 01-G17, 01-G23,
    01-G24, 05-G3) against `tests/features/`.

## Slice 2: Process Contract

### Deletions Note

No existing tests were deleted in this slice. Spec section 9.3 lists no candidate
tests for slice 2. Existing e2e tests in `tests/e2e/process_contract.rs` and
`tests/e2e/workflow.rs` stay in place. All seven scenarios added in
`tests/features/process.feature` supply new BDD executable specifications for the
process contract without removing existing Rust tests.

### Pilot Rubric Answer (Slice 2 Close)

- **Question 3: Can a second cold session write one more scenario from this
  spec alone, with no framework-source read and no fixture beyond `Sandbox` and
  `LastRun`?**
  **Answer: Yes.**
  - **Evidence:** A fresh session wrote the scenario `Missing template exits
    with code one and reports template not found diagnostic` in
    `tests/features/process.feature`. It passed on the first run.
  - The session read no `rstest-bdd` source. It used only `Sandbox` and
    `LastRun`.
  - One gap: the spec does not list the diagnostic code strings. The session
    read `src/cli/error.rs` to find `traces::cli::template::not_found`.
    Authors of later slices must expect to read the code for code strings.

## Slice 8: Spawned-Signal Exit 130 (Dropped)

No scenario was written and no test was deleted. The user decided
(2026-11-03) to drop the slice before the signal dev-dependency landed.

### Spike Results (Entry Condition 9.7)

- **Platform gating.** `scenarios!` generates one test for every feature file
  in the directory it scans, and a missing step fails at run time with
  `Step not found` (spec section 2). Cfg-gating the step definitions alone
  would leave Windows generating a test whose steps do not exist. The clean
  gate is a second `#[cfg(unix)] scenarios!("tests/features/unix", ...)`
  call over a separate `tests/features/unix/` directory. The `check:layers`
  feature-text checks and the sixth gate check scan `tests/features/`
  recursively, so the nested directory stays visible to them. Windows
  behavior is [INFERENCE]; CI was never run for this layout.
- **Exit 130 mechanics.** `src/main.rs` returns `ExitCode::from(130)` only
  for `CommandOutcome::Aborted(UserAbort::Interrupted)`. That outcome is
  produced only when a dialog error chain holds
  `DialogError::UserInterrupted`. `inquire` reports that error
  (`OperationInterrupted`) only when the prompt runs on a real TTY.
  `src/dialog/terminal.rs` guards every prompt with `stdin_is_tty` and
  answers from a fallback table otherwise. A piped-stdin child that receives
  SIGINT dies by signal, so `ExitStatus::code()` is `None`, and no assertion
  of a numeric 130 is possible without a pseudoterminal.
- **Readiness.** Deterministic prompt readiness (poll an observable, never
  `sleep`) requires reading the prompt output, which again needs a
  pseudoterminal. Spec section 4 bans a PTY harness.
- **Dependency.** `rustix` is a dev-dependency (1.1.5, `fs` feature). Its
  `process` feature would cover `kill`; its `pty` feature would cover the
  pseudoterminal. Both stay unadded.

### Decision

Known limitation. The 130 pin stays in the unit layer:
`src/main.rs::ctrl_c_abort_exits_130` (outcome to exit-code mapping) and
`src/cli/mod.rs::user_interrupted_during_template_picker_returns_aborted_interrupted`
(interrupt mapping through `CliError::user_abort`). Spec sections 9.3, 9.7,
9.9 item 13, 10 and 12 record the decision. Research/10 row 01-G1 notes the
130 part as pinned; the class-level map row names the same pin.
